Python implementation of remote controls for pianobar. 

To test, 
Open a terminal
     $ python remote.py
Open another terminal
     $ echo "playpause" | nc -u localhost 64266

Assumptions: 
1. Your username and password are stored in your config file
2. You have at least 20 stations (it's hardcoded in remote.py -- my bad)
